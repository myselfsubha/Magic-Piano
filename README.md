Magic Piano is a fun and interactive web application that allows users to play a virtual piano. The app features a responsive design, engaging animations, and two demo music sequences, including a simplified version of the popular song "Tum Hi Ho". When music is played, colorful bubbles animate at the top of the piano, adding a visually appealing touch to the experience.
